# Simple RISC-V Assembler
Assembles simple RISC-V programs to .mem files for use by my CPU.

Because every good CPU needs its own assembler....

I would like to get better at Python while also doing something relevant to my other project, so this is what I've come up with. I think it will be an interesting challenge.
